# Blues | Ballads | Cowboy Songs


Blues | Ballads | Cowboy Songs is the latest record from Austin, TX based folk/blues singer and guitarist Peter Keane.  It is his first record since Rural Electrification was released in 2015.  

The Ohio-born musician made a name for himself in the Boston folk music scene in the 80s and released his first record The Goodnight Blues in 1992.  Moving to Austin, TX in 1994, he released Walkin’ Around (Rounder Records) in 1996 and followed that up with Another Kind of Blue (2000) and Milton Street (2002) before taking time off from music to get married and start a family.

As the title suggests, this new record displays a wide range of material from the deep blues of Skip James (Special Rider Blues) to the country blues of Hank Williams (Crazy Heart) with some Merle Travis (Dry Bread, I Am a Pilgrim) and Ramblin’ Jack Elliott-sourced cowboy tunes (Cool Water, Diamond Joe) in the mix. Keane’s original Almost Gone gets a swinging-rootsy take complete with tremolo baritone guitar, and Blaze Foley’s Clay Pigeons features steel guitarist extraordinaire Marty Muse.

The songs rest on the foundation of Keane’s fine fingerstyle guitar (on a 50s vintage Gibson archtop) and simple and effective bass playing. Add a bit of percussion and steel guitar and the result is a remarkably rich and fully-realized record.
